I think that I used most of this time to try and conceptualize what the problem was asking. I was a bit confused by what the challenge was in the first place, and why it wasn't just incredibly obvious in the same way of just brute forcing it, but then I realized the struggle in that, and started thinking about how I wanted to break it down. |
| Jan 26  | 12:45-1:45pm | Really just used most of this time as Mr. Blick was saying to just get reps in with how certain breakdowns of change would work and testing out certain methods. We didn't code in this time as we figured it would be best to first fully understand the problemset. We spent most of the class working throuhg problems using the idea that Lucas, Zander, and I had about using recursion and memoization to go throuhg the different cases, but we had a weird situation where we would have duplicates based on unique permutations. We thought there aws a mathematical way to figure this out, but apparenlty we were on the wrong track. We essentially spent the whole class trying to figure out a way to break it down from like the top down, but honestly, this didn't end being the right appraoch. At then end of class, Mr. Blick revealed the core idea being to reduce the number of different coins, in order to simplify the problemset. |
| Jan 26  |   8-8:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I spent this time kind of thinking of what Mr. Blick said about breaking donw the number of possible coins used. I tried some examples with numbers I made up and tried to split the problemset up into cases with different subsets of coins, but I didn't really see a pattern when I tried it out here, so I was stumped for the time. I decided to just sleep on it and seee if I could figre anything out the next day. |
| Jan 27  |   8:15-9pm   |                 I continued to try and break down the problemset into subsets. i think I figured it out kind of in this time, because I was able to break it down into different sets of numbers and just add their casess up, which made the problemset be broken down into simpler sets. The problem with this though was that it seemed to me that it would be incredibly inefficient, so I was trying to think of how I could kind of incroproate my previous idea into this about using memoization. I tried a few more practice examples where I just broke down the problemset into groups of possible coins, and then saw how it worked out from there, and I ended up gettting the intded total, but it was still really inefficient in my head if I were to code it out, so I am interested to see what Mr. Blick is going to tell us when he reveals the proper theory (although I do think I am onto something with this, its just inefficient). |
