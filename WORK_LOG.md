| Jan 22  |   2:45-3pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Mr. Blick introduced heating up, and we just started by discussing it as a class/as a table. I think that I used most of this time to try and conceptualize what the problem was asking. I was a bit confused by what the challenge was in the first place, and why it wasn't just incredibly obvious in the same way of just brute forcing it, but then I realized the struggle in that, and started thinking about how I wanted to break it down. |
| Jan 26  | 12:45-1:45pm | Really just used most of this time as Mr. Blick was saying to just get reps in with how certain breakdowns of change would work and testing out certain methods. We didn't code in this time as we figured it would be best to first fully understand the problemset. We spent most of the class working throuhg problems using the idea that Lucas, Zander, and I had about using recursion and memoization to go throuhg the different cases, but we had a weird situation where we would have duplicates based on unique permutations. We thought there aws a mathematical way to figure this out, but apparenlty we were on the wrong track. We essentially spent the whole class trying to figure out a way to break it down from like the top down, but honestly, this didn't end being the right appraoch. At then end of class, Mr. Blick revealed the core idea being to reduce the number of different coins, in order to simplify the problemset. |
| Jan 26  |   8-8:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I spent this time kind of thinking of what Mr. Blick said about breaking donw the number of possible coins used. I tried some examples with numbers I made up and tried to split the problemset up into cases with different subsets of coins, but I didn't really see a pattern when I tried it out here, so I was stumped for the time. I decided to just sleep on it and seee if I could figre anything out the next day. |
| Jan 27  |   8:15-9pm   |                 I continued to try and break down the problemset into subsets. i think I figured it out kind of in this time, because I was able to break it down into different sets of numbers and just add their casess up, which made the problemset be broken down into simpler sets. The problem with this though was that it seemed to me that it would be incredibly inefficient, so I was trying to think of how I could kind of incroproate my previous idea into this about using memoization. I tried a few more practice examples where I just broke down the problemset into groups of possible coins, and then saw how it worked out from there, and I ended up gettting the intded total, but it was still really inefficient in my head if I were to code it out, so I am interested to see what Mr. Blick is going to tell us when he reveals the proper theory (although I do think I am onto something with this, its just inefficient). |
| Jan 29  |    8-9pm     |                                                                                                                                                                               We learned about the memoization approach in the preivous class where you broke the problem down smallesr sets of coins using including and excluding. Honestly, this made a lto of sense to me because it was kind of what I was thinking about before this day. So then, I was able to start implementing it pretty fluidly. I ran into a bit of an issue with the recursive aspect of it and how it moved through the table in the slides. But I wrote it out a couple of times and it actually made sense, which made it start to make so much more sense. I think that writing out the whole tree actually mading the coding aspect a lot easier. I wasn't quite able to finish it before the next class, but I made quite a lot of progress in the memoization approach. |

I also talked with my group and Mr. Blick while learning about it. I think that the wapproach, now that we have learned the other approach with memoization, I think this one just made so much more sense. The table with the 2d arrays made a lot of sense visually, so it cleared thkngs up a lot for tabulation for me. I didn't write any code for tabulation during this time, but I did continue to work on my memoization approach. |
| Jan 31  |    8-9pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Finished up the memoization approach. It passed all the tests, but it wasn't the most efficient, so I think that tabulation will work a bit better. I was able to wrap this up pretty easily, with the only issue being figuring out the boundaries/borders for the base cases, because it confused me a bit, but I was able to figure it out after spending a bit of time with the recursion code. It ended up working, so I moved on to tabulation, but I was just going to do that tomorrow. |

This was actually really easy now that I coded the memoization approach. I got a bit confused with the 2d array, but I was able to figure it out because it actually made more sense to store it in a 2d array, so that wasn't that much of a problem. This went by really quickly, and I was able to code an approach that worked really efficiently, so I think that I did it really well. This work time was really efficient and fast, and I was surprised I was able to sovle the tabulation approach this quickly. |

I also talked to my groupmates about their approach. We had somewhat similar approaches across the board, with some very minor differences. But most of this time was spent writing work log + comments. |
